# Trove

**English** · [한국어](README.ko.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md) · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**Trove** is a local-first desktop app for your [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) history (formerly *Claude Vault*, then *ccStory*: Anthropic's guidelines keep "Claude" out of third-party product names, and Trove drops the reference altogether). It indexes your conversations and keeps them even after Claude Code deletes old transcripts. Everything is searchable in milliseconds (SQLite FTS5), and you can find and reuse your own prompts.

- **Privacy.**
  - Claude's files are read-only: the app never writes under `~/.claude/`.
  - The index and its backups live in a local SQLite DB under your user data directory.
  - To measure its own usefulness, Trove records the *dates* you opened it (no times, no content) in that DB for the Stats tab. Nothing leaves the machine.
  - The only network request is an update check against GitHub Releases. It sends no conversation data and can be turned off in **Settings** ([ADR-0005](docs/decisions/0005-update-check-network-exception.md)).
- **Platforms.** macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel) is the primary target. Windows and Linux builds pass the same end-to-end test in CI but see less day-to-day use.
- **License.** MIT, see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Install

Download the file for your system from [Releases](https://github.com/RosieOh/trove/releases). The builds are **not code-signed yet**, so the first launch needs one extra confirmation.

**macOS:** `Trove-<version>-mac-arm64.dmg` (Apple Silicon) or `…-mac-x64.dmg` (Intel).

1. Open the DMG and drag **Trove** to Applications.
2. Open it once. macOS says it cannot verify the developer; click **Done**.
3. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to "Trove was blocked…" and click **Open Anyway**. On macOS 14 and earlier, right-click the app and choose **Open** instead.
4. Alternatively, in a terminal: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Trove.app"`.

Unsigned macOS builds cannot update themselves; new versions appear on the Releases page.

**Windows:** run `Trove-<version>-win-x64.exe`. If SmartScreen says "Windows protected your PC", choose **More info → Run anyway**. It installs for the current user.

**Linux:** use either package.
- AppImage: `chmod +x Trove-*.AppImage && ./Trove-*.AppImage`.
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ./Trove-*.deb`.

**First run.** Trove reads `~/.claude/projects` and `~/.claude/plans` (and `~/.codex/sessions` if you use Codex CLI) and indexes them on a background thread, so the window stays responsive. A 5 GB history takes about a minute; after that only new lines are read. To point it elsewhere, set `CLAUDE_HOME` / `CODEX_HOME` to absolute paths.

## Screenshots

| My prompts: what you typed, most used first | Stats: tokens once per API response, cost, days you used Trove |
|---|---|
| ![My prompts](docs/images/prompts.png) | ![Stats](docs/images/stats.png) |
| **Full session**: the whole conversation, tool output folded | **Dark theme** |
| ![Session transcript](docs/images/transcript.png) | ![Stats in the dark theme](docs/images/stats-dark.png) |

The screenshots use a synthetic demo history (`scripts/demo-corpus.mjs`); regenerate them with `npx vite build && node scripts/screenshots.mjs`.

## Features

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Indexing of `~/.claude/projects` (root `{uuid}.jsonl`, `subagents/`, `agent-transcripts/`, `sessions-index.json`) and `~/.claude/plans` | Yes — append-only, on a background worker |
| **Archive**: sessions Claude Code deletes stay searchable (badged "Archived"); purge is explicit | Yes (default on) |
| Full-text search + project / role / date / meta / subagents / **tool output** / **tag** filters | Yes |
| Match modes (OR / AND / phrase), sort (relevance / newest / oldest), substring fallback for infix & CJK | Yes |
| **My prompts**: what you typed, deduplicated, recent or most used | Yes |
| **Files**: which sessions touched a file, when, on which branch | Yes |
| Favorites and tags that survive re-indexing and upgrades | Yes |
| Session transcript modal (markdown, meta/tool toggles, archived banner) | Yes |
| Prompt templates with `{{variables}}` | Yes |
| Command palette (⌘/Ctrl+K), keyboard result navigation | Yes |
| Stats: days you opened Trove per week (the roadmap's go/no-go measure) | Yes |
| Usage stats per model, counted **once per API response**; cost estimate with 5-minute / 1-hour cache writes and an editable, dated price table (Claude and the OpenAI models Codex uses) | Yes |
| Export Markdown / CSV — copy or save to a file | Yes |
| **Backups**: daily DB snapshots plus one before upgrades, purges and restores; restore in Settings; a DB that won't open is recovered from the newest backup | Yes (keeps 3) |
| Settings: archive mode, backups, update checks, data location, full re-read | Yes |
| Codex CLI sessions (`~/.codex/sessions`, grouped by working directory) | Best effort |
| Korean / English UI, light / dark theme | Yes |

## Documentation

See the [docs/](docs/README.md) directory (PRD, architecture, ADRs, roadmap, release process).

[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — what changed in each version.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To open DevTools automatically while developing (Chromium logs some harmless noise to the terminal):

```bash
VAULT_OPEN_DEVTOOLS=1 npm run dev
```

Otherwise open them from **View → Developer Tools** or **⌥⌘I** on macOS. When running from a VS Code terminal or agent, unset `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` first (`env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE npm run dev`).

Other scripts:

- `npm run build` — typecheck, production Vite build, installer via `electron-builder`.
- `npm run typecheck` — main/preload/shared and the renderer.
- `npm run lint` — ESLint (flat config).
- `npm test` — unit tests (parsers, search helpers, pricing, IPC guards).
- `npm run test:db` — SQLite integration tests (indexing, archive, migrations, search, backups).
- `npm run test:e2e` — end-to-end smoke test: launches the built app (`npx vite build` first) against fixture transcripts and drives it with Playwright.
- `npm run bench -- <vault.db>` — search latency on an existing index.
- `npm run poc` — CLI scan of your transcripts with parser stats (no GUI, no DB).

Environment overrides: `CLAUDE_HOME`, `CODEX_HOME` (absolute paths), `VAULT_USER_DATA` (put the vault DB somewhere disposable), `VAULT_DISABLE_UPDATER=1`.

CI (GitHub Actions) runs typecheck, lint, unit tests, DB integration tests and the renderer build, plus the end-to-end smoke test on macOS, Windows and Linux, on every push/PR.
